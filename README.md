# LinuxColdHeart Coming Soon!
The Linux version of the Coldheart framework

This is the project Coldheart. This framework is a replacement for the NSA's execution environment 'Fuzzbunch' and 
written in Python 2.7. The main purpose of Coldheart is to quickly, easily, and effectively run operations similar to 
those ran in fuzzbunch. For those who don't know, fuzzbunch contains a wide range of exploits and other things (credit: NSA).
Currently Coldheart only supports two exploits: Eternalblue, and Doublepulsar (used to hack windows machines) and a 
few 'touch' programs for information gathering. More exploits to be added soon.
